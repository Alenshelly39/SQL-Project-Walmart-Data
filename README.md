# SQL-Project-Walmart-Data
 This project aims to perform an in-depth analysis of a Walmart sales dataset to uncover critical  business insights and inform strategic decision-making.
 The analysis covers a full year of data to quantify total revenue, identify top-performing product categories and best-selling items, and pinpoint seasonal sales trends. 
 Furthermore, the project investigates customer behavior by calculating the revenue contribution of repeat customers, examining common payment methods by category, and analyzing product ratings.
 The resulting queries provide actionable intelligence on inventory management, marketing strategies for high-potential products, and insights into customer satisfaction across different geographic locations.
